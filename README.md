# Gentle Introduction to Regression

A gentle, low-code and low-math introduction to regression in the context of machine learning.

## Session description
In this session, we will discuss algorithms that model the relationship between two or more numerical variables: Estimating the USD price of a house based on its features, predict trends in college registration numbers, or estimate the number of library visitors on a given day based on weather or other factors. You will gain an intuitive understanding of how this relationship is found and learn about the limitations and pitfalls of these tasks.

It will be helpful, but not required, to attend the session on Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning: Statistics earlier in the term.

Complementing this session, there is also a workshop on Classification, which highlights another main branch of machine learning techniques.
